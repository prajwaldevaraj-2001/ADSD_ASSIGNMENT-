# Flask Application and Template Line-by-Line Commentary

## app.py

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
import sqlite3
```
- Imports the `Flask` class to create the web application and `render_template` to render HTML templates. `sqlite3` is imported to interact with the SQLite database.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
- Creates a new instance of the Flask web application.

```python
connection = sqlite3.connect("pets.db", check_same_thread=False)
```
- Opens a connection to an SQLite database called `pets.db`. The `check_same_thread=False` argument allows the connection to be shared across multiple threads, which may be necessary when handling multiple requests.

```python
@app.route("/")
@app.route("/hello")
def get_hello():
    return "<p>Hello there, World!</p>"
```
- Defines two routes (`/` and `/hello`) that return the same HTML response: a simple message saying "Hello there, World!"

```python
@app.route("/list")
def get_list():
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("select * from pets")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    rows = [list(row) for row in rows]
    print(rows)
    return render_template("list.html", prof={"name": "Dr. D", "class": "ADSD"}, rows=rows)
```
- Defines a route `/list` that:
  - Creates a cursor object from the SQLite connection.
  - Executes a SQL query to select all rows from the `pets` table.
  - Fetches all the rows from the query result.
  - Converts each row into a list.
  - Prints the rows to the console.
  - Passes the rows and a dictionary containing the professor's name and class to the `list.html` template for rendering.

```python
@app.route("/delete/<id>")
def get_delete(id):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""delete from pets where id = ?""", (id,))
    connection.commit()
    return f"<p>Deleted ID={[id]}!</p>"
```
- Defines a route `/delete/<id>` that:
  - Takes an `id` as a parameter from the URL.
  - Executes a SQL `DELETE` query to remove the row from the `pets` table with the specified `id`.
  - Commits the change to the database.
  - Returns a message confirming the deletion of the record with the specified ID.

```python
@app.route("/goodbye")
def get_goodbye():
    return "<p>Goodbye, then! Have a nice day!</p>"
```
- Defines a route `/goodbye` that returns a simple message: "Goodbye, then! Have a nice day!"

## list.html

```html
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        This is the list template.
        Hello, {{ prof["name"] }}. I'm enjoying {{ prof["class"] }}!
```
- Basic HTML document structure. The professor's name and class, passed as `prof` from the Flask app, are displayed dynamically using Jinja templating syntax (`{{ }}`).

```html
        <table>
        {% for row in rows %}
            <tr>
                <td>The data is</td>
                {% for item in row %}
                    <td>{{ item }}</td>
                {% endfor %}
                <td><a href="/delete/{{ row[0] }}">Delete</a></td>
            </tr>
        {% endfor %}
        </table>
```
- A table is created, and it iterates over the `rows` (which is the list of pet records passed from the Flask app).
  - For each `row`, a new table row (`<tr>`) is created.
  - Each item in the row is displayed inside table data cells (`<td>`).
  - At the end of each row, a "Delete" link is generated, using the first element of the row (`row[0]`, which is assumed to be the pet's ID) to create a link to the `/delete` route with that ID.
```
